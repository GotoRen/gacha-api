## Concept of this project
This project was started to run the gacha API writen by Golang on AWS.<br>
Built an API for creating basic applications and designed the infrastructure for operation.<br>
It can be run locally with docker-compose. The production will be operated using AWS ECS, AWS RDS (Aurora), etc...<br>

## Overview
First, I would like to be able to use basic AWS services as I catch up.<br>
Then, touching and learning the features of each service, and desire to utilize the technology selection process in the future.<br>
Additionally, this product is designed with [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) in mind as well as catch-up.<br>
For example, "auto-scale", "load-balancing", "monitoring and notification", "log-collection and log-analysis".<br>
Finally, I will actively incorporate technologies in which we are interested.<br>

## Concept of DevOps architecture

### Deployment by CI/CD

Continuous Integration pushes the Docker image to the ECR via yaml (run) configured in the github workflows.<br>
Image information is defined in JSON and stored in S3.<br>
CodePipeline uses S3 as a source and pull image from ECR and deploy to ECS.<br>
This is typically a continuous deployment.<br>

### Design of infrastructure

First, for fault tolerance, set up separate instances in different Availability-Zone and deploy ALB to distribute traffic.<br>
Additionally, in order to achieve a more production-like service, I used Route53 and added domain names to the operation.<br>
Connection information to Aurora was set up using Systems Manager's ParameterStore with environment variables to enable secure connections.<br>
Finally, in conjunction with CI/CD, we were aware of Immutable Infrastructure so as not to change the configuration of the infrastructure once it was built.<br>
This allows for continuous DevOps even after the start of operations.<br>

### Monitoring and Notification„ÄÄ

- Monitoring<br>
When deployed, the system detects CodePipeline events and notifies Slack in combination with AWS's SNS and AWS's Chatbot.<br>
Additionally, UptimeRobot is incorporated as a monitoring tool and the entire service is monitored externally.<br>

- Logging<br>
I used Lambda and Kinesis DataFirehose for logging.<br>
Typically, this would be completed by Logs Insights. However, I would like to deal with various technologies. This is my concept!<br>
The acquired logs are stored in S3 and queries are executed from Athena (Glue).<br>
